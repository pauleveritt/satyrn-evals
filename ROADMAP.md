# Roadmap

> **Planning surface, not the front door.** Where the current phase, the
> concept budget, deferred candidates, and the backlog live. Not where a
> new contributor should start — see
> [`README.md`](README.md) for what's usable now.

*Phases group feature cycles. One direction at a time. Tangents go to the
Backlog, not into the current phase.*

## Now

**Repository scaffolding — complete.** The repository is initialized with
the toolchain (`uv`, `ruff`, `pyrefly`, `pytest`), the docs stack (Sphinx,
MyST, Furo, sphinx-autobuild behind a Justfile recipe), CI for Pages, and
the superpowers structure. The roadmap itself — phases of feature cycles
derived from the two-repo rewrite brief — is **not yet written**; the
brief names the diagnostic slices (offline grade, capture by revert,
attempt persistence, real engine attempt, batch diagnostics) and this
section will record them in named phases once the roadmap is authored.

## Concept budget

*Every term below is a cost against a 5–10 h/wk volunteer's ability to hold
the design in mind. Checked and updated at the end of each cycle; a term
earns its place by naming something the design actually needs, not by being
convenient shorthand.*

No terms yet. The concept budget starts empty and is earned.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Direction (one sentence) | Status |
|---|-------|--------------------------|--------|
| — | *(pending — roadmap not yet authored)* | The evals brief's slices: offline grade, capture by revert, attempt persistence, real engine attempt, batch diagnostics | not started |

## Backlog

Deferred ideas land here, never into the current phase. Nothing is
scheduled yet.

## Prior work

Completed phases move here (or to `docs/superpowers/phase-history.md`)
when the roadmap outgrows the front page. Nothing here yet.

## Workflow

This repository runs on spec-driven development — see
[`docs/sdd.md`](docs/sdd.md). Each feature cycle gets a committed design
spec, an implementation plan, then code. The default test suite needs no
model, network, or subprocess; process behavior lives in a small marked
integration tier.
