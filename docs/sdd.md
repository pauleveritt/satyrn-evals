# How we work

This repository runs on **spec-driven development**: every feature cycle
produces a design spec (what we're building and why) and an implementation
plan (the task-by-task decomposition), both committed before the code.

The cycle shape, from the superpowers workflow:

1. **Brainstorm** — clarify the idea into a design, present it, get
   approval.
2. **Spec** — write the validated design to
   `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`, commit it.
3. **Plan** — write the implementation plan to
   `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`, commit it.
4. **Implement** — work the plan in reviewable cycles, each ending with a
   command a contributor can run and evidence that names a success fixture
   and a failure fixture.
5. **Record** — completed phases, and the withdrawn framings and retracted
   figures found along the way, move to the archive section of
   `ROADMAP.md` rather than being edited away.

The disciplines review holds you to:

- **Concept budget** — new jargon is a cost against a 5–10 h/wk
  contributor's ability to hold the design in mind.
- **Non-vacuity** — a refusal test has a sibling success test.
- **Verify, don't assert** — demonstrate a claim, don't state it.
