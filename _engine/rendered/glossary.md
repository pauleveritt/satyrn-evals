# Glossary

Terms earn a place here when a phase lands the concept; the roadmap's concept
budget tracks which names the design actually needs.

**adapter**

The thin TypeScript layer that makes the engine reachable inside Pi as the
`/implement` command and, with an explicit mutation context, a bounded
`edit` tool. `/implement` starts E3 delivery with an E5 attempt inside;
each bounded edit sends one versioned request to the Python mutation
protocol. It converts transport failures into contained results and owns no
contract, mutation, or Git policy.

**attempt**

One E5 run of an explicitly selected Pi model. Standalone invocation expects
the caller to supply a clean disposable Git worktree; it does not create
isolation itself. `/implement` supplies that worktree through E3 delivery.
The model receives only `read` and E4's bounded `edit`. The transcript
and patch are evidence artifacts published through pinned directories
outside every registered worktree and Git administrative directory, not a
grading verdict; E3 decides whether the resulting tree becomes a candidate.

**check**

The engine's first operation: parse and validate a contract, lint the
repository path it names, and either accept it (exit `0`) or refuse
with a named cause. Exposed as the `check` subcommand and the
`check()` library seam.

**carried**

`preserve` and `checks` paths (plus tracked test infrastructure)
restored from the accepted base into the worktree before every
self_test run and before validation, so the model's edits to them
never count.

**candidate**

A commit produced by one successful delivery attempt and published at
`refs/satyrn/candidates/<contract-id>/head`. It has the captured base
commit as its parent. It is reviewable Git state, not a branch, merge, or
automatic change to the caller's checkout.

**candidate ref**

The create-once Git ref naming a candidate. The contract id is the
logical identity and the commit SHA is the exact revision. Git's shared ref
namespace makes the identity the same across symlink spellings and linked
worktrees of one repository.

**contract**

A bounded, declarative description of a change to make, written as a
YAML file. Its top level is a mapping with two required fields, `id`
and `task` (both non-empty strings). E4 adds optional `writable_paths`
patterns; omitting them permits no bounded replacement. Unknown fields are
ignored. See usage for the accepted shape. The spec's `objective`
and `self_test_command` are this file's `task` and `test_command`.

**engine**

The Python core of satyrn-engine: a library and command-line tool that
parses and validates a contract, applies one bounded replacement, runs one
model attempt, and delivers a candidate change without modifying the
caller's working tree. Invoked from the shell as `satyrn-engine`.

**exit code**

The process exit status returned by `satyrn-engine`. The values are a
stable contract: `0` succeeds; `2` through `7` retain the check and
protocol meanings; delivery uses `8` for every handled result without a
candidate; mutation uses `9` for an accepted replacement refusal; attempt
failures use `10`; and `1` is reserved for an uncaught internal error —
a crash, never a refusal. A delivery receipt or mutation JSON response gives
the precise cause.

**guard**

A small TypeScript check that observes an ordinary Pi tool call before it
runs. Four guards ship: the loop breaker, which remembers the last twenty
admitted call keys and refuses a sixth exact repeat while five matches remain
in that window, and runs in every Pi session (`engine.ts`); writable-path
scope, symbol preservation, and command bounds, which register only inside
the `/implement` child (`scope.ts`, `bounds.ts`, loaded there by explicit
`--extension` flags, not through the package's own extension list). Each
guard's state belongs to one extension registration. A guard is not a
mutation policy or a Python engine operation.

**guard firing**

A `pi.appendEntry` custom entry a guard records when it acts. The receipt
counts these from the child's json stream as `entry_appended` events; no
file the model's shell can reach is evidence.

**integration tier**

The marked test tier (`@pytest.mark.integration`) that starts real
subprocesses and, for delivery, real local Git repositories and commands.
It is excluded from the hermetic default run and from CI (``addopts = -m
"not integration"`); run it explicitly with `uv run pytest -m
integration``.

**protocol**

The one-shot JSON surface between the adapter and the engine: one
versioned request on stdin, one versioned response on stdout, then exit.
The response is authoritative; the process exit code mirrors it so a
caller that cannot parse the response still has a named signal. Version
mismatches are refused, not guessed at.

**revision**

The lowercase SHA-256 hash of a file's exact bytes at the point the engine
read it. E4 accepts a replacement only when the caller's prior revision still
equals the current file. A successful replacement returns the next revision;
a determinate engine refusal never advances it. A transport failure poisons
the context because the publication result is unknown.

**self_test**

The engine's registered tool that restores carried tests, runs the
contract's `test_command` and the checks, and returns failed ids with
their first assertion line.

**receipt**

The one versioned UTF-8 JSON result written by an accepted `deliver`
operation. Its closed `code` vocabulary names the exact cause; `outcome`
is the candidate-lifecycle category derived from that code, and the shell
exit is a separate derived transport signal. The remaining fields record the
base, candidate, changed paths, command status, and any retained cleanup path.

**refusal**

A deliberate, named rejection of a contract or repository. Over the CLI
it is reported as a one-line `satyrn-engine: <CAUSE>: <detail>`
message on stderr with a stable exit code; over the protocol it
travels as a JSON response on stdout whose `code` names the cause. A
refusal is a verdict; a crash is not a refusal.

**tripwire**

The autouse test fixture that forbids the default tier from spawning a
process or opening a network socket, failing any test that does. Proven
once by a planted process-spawning test, then kept to constrain every
later phase's tests.

**working tree**

The checked-out directory tree the engine operates against (the
`--repo` argument). `check` lints that the path exists and is a
directory. `deliver` requires a clean Git root and never writes to this
caller-owned tree.

**worktree isolation**

Running one delivery command in a temporary linked Git worktree detached at
a captured base commit. Ordinary writes land outside the caller's checkout;
the temporary worktree is removed before a candidate ref is published. Git
registration uncertainty and process-teardown uncertainty both retain the
path rather than deleting it unsafely. It is isolation from the caller's
files and index, not a security sandbox.
