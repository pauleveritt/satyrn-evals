"""Shared fixtures for the phased acceptance checks.

Extracted from agentclinic-repair-depth-3/overlay/test_acceptance.py so
that phase 1 is independently collectable: that module imports `models`
at load, and collection imports before selection, so a phase-1 workspace
with no models.py fails at import for every selector.

Nothing here touches models. Assertion bodies in the sibling test modules
are copied verbatim from the source; only the module structure differs.
